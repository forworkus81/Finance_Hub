                <p>
                    We all make financial missteps, especially when we're just starting out. But some money mistakes can cost you for years—high-interest debt, missed savings opportunities, or bad credit. The good news? Most are avoidable with the right knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are the <strong>top money mistakes</strong> people make and <strong>how to dodge them</strong> like a financial pro.
                </p>

                <hr>

                <h3>1. Not Having a Budget (Or Ignoring It)</h3>
                <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> Spending blindly and wondering where your paycheck went.<br>
                <strong>The Fix:</strong> Track income and expenses. Use the <strong>50/30/20 rule</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>50% Needs (rent, groceries, bills)</li>
                    <li>30% Wants (dining, entertainment)</li>
                    <li>20% Savings/Debt</li>
                </ul>
                <blockquote>
                    "A budget is telling your money where to go instead of wondering where it went." — Dave Ramsey
                </blockquote>

                <hr>

                <h3>2. Living Paycheck to Paycheck</h3>
                <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> Having no emergency fund when unexpected expenses hit.<br>
                <strong>The Fix:</strong> Save <strong>at least $500–$1,000</strong> as a starter emergency fund, then build to <strong>3–6 months’ expenses</strong>.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    "An emergency fund turns a crisis into an inconvenience." — Suze Orman
                </blockquote>

                <hr>

                <h3>3. Misusing Credit Cards</h3>
                <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> Maxing out cards or paying only the minimum.<br>
                <strong>The Fix:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>✔ Keep credit utilization <strong>below 30%</strong></li>
                    <li>✔ <strong>Pay in full</strong> every month to avoid interest</li>
                    <li>✔ Use cards for rewards, not debt</li>
                </ul>
                <blockquote>
                    "Credit card debt is the worst kind of debt—it’s expensive and never goes away." — The Money Coach
                </blockquote>

                <hr>

                <h3>4. Ignoring High-Interest Debt</h3>
                <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> Letting credit card or payday loan debt snowball.<br>
                <strong>The Fix:</strong> Attack debt with the <strong>Avalanche Method</strong> (highest interest first) or <strong>Snowball Method</strong> (smallest balance first).</p>
                <blockquote>
                    "Debt is like any other trap—easy to get into, hard to get out of." — Josh Billings
                </blockquote>

                <hr>

                <h3>5. Not Investing Early</h3>
                <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> Waiting to invest until you’re "rich enough."<br>
                <strong>The Fix:</strong> Start small! Even <strong>$50/month</strong> in an <strong>index fund or retirement account</strong> grows over time.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now." — Chinese Proverb
                </blockquote>

                <hr>

                <h3>6. Impulse Spending</h3>
                <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> Buying things you don’t need because of sales or emotions.<br>
                <strong>The Fix:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>✔ Wait <strong>24–48 hours</strong> before big purchases</li>
                    <li>✔ Unsubscribe from marketing emails</li>
                    <li>✔ Use cash for discretionary spending</li>
                </ul>
                <blockquote>
                    "Beware of little expenses; a small leak will sink a great ship." — Benjamin Franklin
                </blockquote>

                <hr>

                <h3>7. No Financial Goals</h3>
                <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> Drifting without savings targets.<br>
                <strong>The Fix:</strong> Set <strong>SMART goals</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Specific (e.g., "$5,000 emergency fund")</li>
                    <li>Measurable (track progress monthly)</li>
                    <li>Achievable (realistic steps)</li>
                    <li>Relevant (aligns with priorities)</li>
                    <li>Time-bound (deadline: "in 12 months")</li>
                </ul>
                <blockquote>
                    "A goal without a plan is just a wish." — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
                </blockquote>

                <hr>

                <h3>8. Not Checking Credit Reports</h3>
                <p><strong>The Mistake:</strong> Ignoring errors that hurt your score.<br>
                <strong>The Fix:</strong> Check <strong>free reports</strong> at <a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com" target="_blank">AnnualCreditReport.com</a> and dispute mistakes.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    "Your credit score is your financial reputation—protect it." — Unknown
                </blockquote>

                <hr>

                <h3>Final Thought: Small Changes = Big Results</h3>
                <p>
                    Avoiding these mistakes isn’t about perfection—it’s about progress. As Warren Buffett says:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    "It's not necessary to do extraordinary things to get extraordinary results."
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    <strong>Goodluck!</strong>
                </p>
