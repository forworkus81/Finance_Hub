                <p>
                    Your credit score is one of the most important numbers in your financial life. Whether you're applying for a loan, renting an apartment, or even getting a job, your credit score plays a major role. If you're new to credit or want to improve your score, this guide will explain everything you need to know.

                <h3>What Is a Credit Score?</h3>
                <p>
                    A <strong>credit score</strong> is a three-digit number (typically between 300 and 850) that represents your creditworthiness—how likely you are to repay borrowed money. Lenders, landlords, and even employers may check it to assess your financial responsibility.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    "Credit is a tool. Used wisely, it can help you build a future. Used poorly, it can ruin your life." — <strong>Dave Ramsey</strong>
                </blockquote>

                <h4>Why Does It Matter?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>✔ Determines loan & credit card approvals</li>
                    <li>✔ Affects interest rates (higher score = lower rates)</li>
                    <li>✔ Impacts renting, insurance, and sometimes job opportunities</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How Is Your Credit Score Calculated?</h3>
                <p>Credit scores are based on five key factors:</p>
                <div style="overflow-x:auto;">
                <table>
                    <thead>

                            <th>Factor</th>
                            <th>Impact on Score</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td><strong>Payment History (35%)</strong></td>
                            <td>Paying bills on time is the #1 factor</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><strong>Credit Utilization (30%)</strong></td>
                            <td>Keep balances below 30% of your limit</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><strong>Length of Credit History (15%)</strong></td>
                            <td>Older accounts help your score</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><strong>Credit Mix (10%)</strong></td>
                            <td>Having different types of credit (loans, cards)</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><strong>New Credit (10%)</strong></td>
                            <td>Too many hard inquiries can hurt your score</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>

                <h3>What’s a Good Credit Score?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>300-579 (Poor)</strong> – Hard to get approved for credit</li>
                    <li><strong>580-669 (Fair)</strong> – May qualify but with higher interest</li>
                    <li><strong>670-739 (Good)</strong> – Eligible for most loans at decent rates</li>
                    <li><strong>740-799 (Very Good)</strong> – Better terms and approvals</li>
                    <li><strong>800-850 (Excellent)</strong> – Best rates and perks</li>

                <h3>How to Build (or Fix) Your Credit Score</h3>
                <h4>1. Pay Bills on Time, Every Time</h4>
                <p>Late payments hurt your score the most. Set up autopay or reminders.</p>
                <h4>2. Keep Credit Card Balances Low</h4>
                <p>Aim to use less than <strong>30%</strong> of your credit limit (ideally under 10%).</p>
                <h4>3. Don’t Close Old Accounts</h4>
                <p>Longer credit history = better score. Keep old cards open (even if unused).</p>
                <h4>4. Limit Hard Inquiries</h4>
                <p>Too many credit applications in a short time can lower your score.</p>
                <h4>5. Check Your Credit Report for Errors</h4>

                <h3>Myths About Credit Scores</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>❌ <strong>"Checking my own score hurts it."</strong> → False! (Soft inquiries don’t affect it.)</li>
                    <li>❌ <strong>"I need to carry a balance to build credit."</strong> → Paying in full is better!</li>
                    <li>❌ <strong>"Closing a credit card helps my score."</strong> → It can actually lower it.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Final Thought</h3>
                <p>
                    Your credit score isn’t just a number—it’s a measure of your financial health. As <strong>Warren Buffett</strong> wisely said:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    "It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it."
