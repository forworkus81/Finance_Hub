                <p>
                    Does the word "investing" sound intimidating? Youâ€™re not alone. Many people think investing is only for the wealthy or financial expertsâ€”but thatâ€™s not true. <strong>Anyone can start investing</strong>, no matter how small their budget.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This beginnerâ€™s guide will break down <strong>what investing is, why it matters, and how to start</strong>â€”even if you only have $50 to begin.

                <h3>Why Should You Start Investing?</h3>

                <h4>1. Beat Inflation</h4>
                <p>
                    Money sitting in a savings account loses value over time due to inflation. Investing helps your money grow faster than prices rise.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    "Inflation is taxation without legislation." â€” Milton Friedman
                </blockquote>

                <h4>2. Build Wealth Over Time</h4>
                <p>
                    Thanks to <strong>compound interest</strong>, small investments today can grow into significant sums over decades.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    "Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it; he who doesnâ€™t, pays it." â€” Albert Einstein
                </blockquote>

                <h4>3. Achieve Financial Freedom</h4>
                <p>
                    Investing can help you:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>âœ” Retire comfortably</li>
                    <li>âœ” Buy a home</li>
                    <li>âœ” Create passive income</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Investing Basics: How It Works</h3>
                <p>
                    When you invest, youâ€™re putting money into assets that can grow in value, such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stocks</strong> (Shares of a company)</li>
                    <li><strong>Bonds</strong> (Loans to governments or corporations)</li>
                    <li><strong>ETFs/Mutual Funds</strong> (Baskets of stocks or bonds)</li>
                    <li><strong>Real Estate</strong> (Property investments)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Your money earns returns through:<br>
                    ðŸ“ˆ <strong>Appreciation</strong> (The asset increases in value)<br>
                    ðŸ’° <strong>Dividends/Interest</strong> (Regular payouts from investments)
                </p>

                </ul>

                <h4>3. Start Small & Simple</h4>
                <ul>
